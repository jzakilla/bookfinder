## Inventory Manager Project
This is a project that grew out of a need to create a solution for a local homeless shelter. They needed a way to track their food donations easily and quickly using a laptop and cheap ($18 on Amazon) handheld barcode scanner. Later, while looking for a book at a used book store the owner couldn't tell me if they had a certain title in stock so I came home and re-wrote this software to make it web based and easier to deploy / use.

## About
The user interface is written in HTML and CSS, and is rendered using Python 3.x and Flask. The database backend is implemented using SQLite3 on the local machine.
